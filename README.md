# Sales-and-Profit-Story-Dashboard-Storytelling-with-Tableau-
Built an interactive Story Dashboard focusing on customer sales and regional profits in the US.
The story walks through: 
1. Sales vs Profit analysis (scatter plot) 
2. State-wise Profit Map 
3. Sub-category performance across regions 4. Data storytelling using Tableau's Story feature 

Outcome: Improved my storytelling skills by using data narratives to support business decisions and uncover hidden trends.
